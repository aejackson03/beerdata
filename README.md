# beerdata
Project Description:
This project utilizes a .csv file containing millions of reviews and information on different beers that was accessed online from data.world. The data in its original form is illegdible but by using Python and Pandas I was able to create a program that tarnsformed the data to show the 15 most rated beers that fit a certain criteria. That criteria was the 15 most reviewed beers with a rating of 4 (out of 5) or higher. 

**After that data was cleaned. A master loop program was created that allowed the user to request information about a specific beer given a list of options.** 



Relevant packages that need installed to run the project.
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
The user needs to install python 3 or higher to run the project.

3+ requirements
1. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.

2. **Does my code meet this???** Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.

3.***NEED*** Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.

4. Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph).

Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project. (For example: “run python main.py” from the command line)
