# beerdata
Project Description:
This project utilizes a .csv file containing millions of reviews and information on different beers that was accessed online from data.world. The data in its original form is illegdible but by using Python and Pandas I was able to create a program that tarnsformed the data to show the 20 most rated beers that fit a certain criteria. That criteria was the 20 most reviewed beers with a rating of 4 (out of 5) or higher. After that data was cleaned a chart was created to better visualize and comprehend what the data was saying.
